## Deployment 📦

Once you have done with your setup (update content). You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use github page to achieve this on the EASIEST WAY

To publish a GitHub repository as a GitHub Pages website, follow these steps🤘:

  1. Ensure that your repository contains an index.html file or any other HTML file you want to serve as the main page of your website.
  2. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
  3. Click on the "Settings" tab.
  4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" or "Pages" section.
  5. Under the "Source" dropdown, select the branch you want to publish (e.g., main or master).
  6. Once you select the branch, GitHub will build and publish your site automatically. You will see a green success message with the URL of your published site.
  7. Access your published site using the provided URL. It may take a few moments for the changes to propagate.

Note: By default, GitHub Pages will publish your site to a URL like **https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}**. Make sure your repository is public if you want to access it publicly.

Additionally, you can choose a custom domain, enable HTTPS, and configure other settings under the "GitHub Pages" section in the repository settings.
